			<h2>Game Design Research</h2>
			<div class="card">				
				<p>
					I always knew game UX had different sets of best principles and design patterns, but reading this article really showed what you have to consider differently when designing games. One strategy I noted was using timing to ensure people don’t immediately skip cut-scenes or important pop-ups. Another one that I found the most interesting was that dialogues with good choices should have the confirmation CTA on the right, while dialogues with bad choices should have the confirmation CTA on the left. This is so users don’t accidentally, for example, reset their progress or close the game. Other points I noted were keeping an element of surprise, like when giving rewards, and using space efficiently through various methods like sliders, dragging objects by specific touchpoints, and pop-ups.

			<h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
			<div class="card">

				<figure>
					<div id="image-container">
						<img src="images/glass.jpeg" alt="glasses">
						<img src="images/bg.jpeg" alt="sunset">

					<span class="bold">Part One:</span> My partner’s images for her every picture assignment tell a story about the different glasses and prescriptions she’s had throughout her lifetime. As she shows the different glasses the background of her design will unblur and change depending on which glasses are showing. The scenic image my partner showed as an example is interesting as I wonder if the time or place is significant to the specific glasses that would be displayed with it. A question I'd ask for example is is it a significant moment that occurred during the time of owning that pair of glasses? One of the most obvious aspects of the image is that the subject has a pair of glasses, however, what makes the image more mysterious is the facial expression that my subject has, and the direct eye contact they have with the camera. I’m curious to see how the subject image will interact with the background image that my partner will implement. One suggestion I could give for the subject photo is perhaps trying different angles like having a version where the subject looks off to the side. Then when overlaid with the background image, it can look like the subject is looking at something in the scenery.

				<p>
					<span class="bold">Part Two:</span> The object in my image tells a story of the little trinkets I own in my room that I got as gifts from other people. It tells a story about me because it showcases the kinds of things that I like and cherish. Seeing the collection of trinkets, also kind of gives a sense of my aesthetic and proves how others pick up on it when they pick out gifts for me. This one is an example of something my friend crocheted for me and gave me for my birthday. Just telling from the picture, it would be hard to tell the time and effort put into handmaking this project and the little details about its texture, softness, etc. For the project, I planned to cut out the images from the background but to make it more compelling, I could shoot the subject from multiple angles or take close-ups to further highlight the detail in the object to show to the audience.

			<h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
			<div class="card">
				<p>
					The site I came across when looking through the Awwwards was emmpo.com. The large zoomed-in picture of the girl's face caught my eye in the initial thumbnail on Awwwards and as I scrolled through the page the bold use of images, colors, text, and other graphic elements continued to play a large role in the overall design of the site. After reading the article, I was really trying to focus on what the images were showing and why. As I scrolled, it became apparent that all the pictures represented females and seemed to surround women's empowerment, even though nowhere in the text mentioned so. This is probably one of the biggest strengths of the website as it conveys that message without words. I was surprised that there wasn't anywhere on the website that really mentioned it besides showing that the creator of this quiz to explore careers was created by a woman herself. I think the only weakness I would say is that though the images do a great job at evoking a female empowerment feeling, sometimes they do seem a bit disconnected from the career aspect of this website. The images are also all very photoshoot-esque and remind me of social media influencers, which is not necessarily bad as that is a valid career in itself. However, the first portion of their website says the careers the quiz explores are all related to creativity, sustainability, in tech, and while I do see some relation in some of the photos, others not so much.

			<h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
			<div class="card">
				<p>
					Some main principles you should consider when using a modal are its structure, how it is triggered, how much space it takes, and what its purpose is. Modals can sometimes disrupt a user's flow and many people instinctively are trained to close them as soon as they see it. This is why it's important to make sure the modal's purpose is communicated. This can be done through descriptive titles and making sure it is user-initiated. This way it won't catch the user off guard. Furthermore, the visual design is also important to consider as you want the size of the modal to be apt and the focus of the background to be blurred or darkened. The call-to-action buttons should also be clearly labeled, allowing users to confidently take their action. Lastly, other factors that designers may forget are accessibility, and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). In conclusion, while learning best practices for modals is important, it is also crucial that designers recognize modals may not always be the solution. We should consider the above factors and iterate on multiple solutions before deciding on one design pattern.

			<h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
			<div class="card">
				<p >This article taught me about the best practices for form design. I learned that it's important to keep the form simple and that we should use consistent design patterns to make it more intuitive. In forms, it's also important to make sure users know what to do and what comes next if there's multiple steps. Including this increase usability and reduce any confusion or possible frustrations. Some ways to do this is by using consistent labels, indicating what is required and not, asking easy questions first and providing placeholder text. Accessibilty is also important by using proper color contrast, sizing fields accordingly and setting up the page for screen readers. One app I thought of that exhibited these beset practices is <a target="_blank" href="https://mobbin.com/flows/7d7aacbe-213b-471e-8b1f-b5b7087bcb65?tab=screens">Duolingo.</a> Duolingo does a good job at making the onboarding fun, simple, visual and uses a very friendly voice for its copywriting. It also shows a progress bar at the top to indicate how far the user is in the onboarding process.</p>
