			<h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
			<div class="card">
				<p>
					Some main principles you should consider when using a modal are its structure, how it is triggered, how much space it takes, and what its purpose is. Modals can sometimes disrupt a user's flow and many people instinctively are trained to close them as soon as they see it. This is why it's important to make sure the modal's purpose is communicated. This can be done through descriptive titles and making sure it is user-initiated. This way it won't catch the user off guard. Furthermore, the visual design is also important to consider as you want the size of the modal to be apt and the focus of the background to be blurred or darkened. The call-to-action buttons should also be clearly labeled, allowing users to confidently take their action. Lastly, other factors that designers may forget are accessibility, and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). In conclusion, while learning best practices for modals is important, it is also crucial that designers recognize modals may not always be the solution. We should consider the above factors and iterate on multiple solutions before deciding on one design pattern.

			<h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
			<div class="card">
				<p >This article taught me about the best practices for form design. I learned that it's important to keep the form simple and that we should use consistent design patterns to make it more intuitive. In forms, it's also important to make sure users know what to do and what comes next if there's multiple steps. Including this increase usability and reduce any confusion or possible frustrations. Some ways to do this is by using consistent labels, indicating what is required and not, asking easy questions first and providing placeholder text. Accessibilty is also important by using proper color contrast, sizing fields accordingly and setting up the page for screen readers. One app I thought of that exhibited these beset practices is <a target="_blank" href="https://mobbin.com/flows/7d7aacbe-213b-471e-8b1f-b5b7087bcb65?tab=screens">Duolingo.</a> Duolingo does a good job at making the onboarding fun, simple, visual and uses a very friendly voice for its copywriting. It also shows a progress bar at the top to indicate how far the user is in the onboarding process.</p>
